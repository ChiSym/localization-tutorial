# ProbComp Localization Tutorial

The Julia file `probcomp-localization-tutorial.jl` describes a Jupyter `.ipynb` notebook using the Jupytext `percent` format.  This notebook requires Julia version >= 1.9.1.

If using VS Code, we recommend using the extension "Jupytext for Notebooks (congyiwu)" to make the translation.

Specific instances of `.ipynb` files (generated for use for particular real-world presentations, from particular commits of the `.jl` file, and including particular computations and graphics) are to be stored *in branches other than `main` of the repo*, to conserve clean diffs.
