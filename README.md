# ProbComp Localization Tutorial

The Julia file `probcomp-localization-tutorial.jl` describes a Jupyter `.ipynb` notebook using the Jupytext `percent` format.

If using VS Code, we recomend using the extension "Jupytext for Notebooks (congyiwu)" to make the translation.

Specific instances of `.ipynb` files, generated for use for particular presentations from particular commits of the `.jl` file and including particular computations and graphics, are to be stored *in branches other than `main` of the repo*, to conserve clean diffs.
