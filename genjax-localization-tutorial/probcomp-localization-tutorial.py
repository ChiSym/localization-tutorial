# # ProbComp Localization Tutorial
#
# This notebook provides an introduction to probabilistic computation (ProbComp). This term refers to a way of expressing probabilistic constructs in a computational paradigm, made precise by a probabilistic programming language (PPL). The programmer can encode their probabilistic intuition for solving a problem into an algorithm. Back-end language work automates the routine but error-prone derivations.

# ## The "real world"
#
# We assume given:
# * A map of a space, together with
# * Some clutters that sometimes unexpectedly exist in that space.
#
# We also assume given a description of a robot's behavior via:
# * An estimated initial pose (position + heading), and
# * A program of controls (advance distance, followed by rotate heading).
#
# *In addition to the uncertainty in the initial pose, we are uncertain about the true execution of the motion of the robot.*
#
# Below, we will also introduce sensors.

# ## Gen basics
#
# As said initially, we are uncertain about the true initial position and subsequent motion of the robot.  In order to reason about these, we now specify a model using `Gen`.
#
# Each piece of the model is declared as a *generative function* (GF).  The `GenJAX` library provides a DSL for constructing GFs signalled by the use of the `@genjax.gen` decorator on an ordinary Python function. As we shall see, in order for the functions we write to be compilable for a GPU, there are certain constraints we must follow in the use of control flow, which we will discuss soon.


# The library offers two basic constructs for use within the DSL: primitive *distributions* such as "bernoulli" and "normal", and the *sampling operator* `@`.  Recursively, GFs may sample from other GFs using `@`.

#
# The foremost information stored in the trace is the *choice map*, which is tree of labels mapping to the corresponding stochastic choices, i.e. occurrences of the `@` operator, that were encountered.  It is accessed by `get_choices`:

# %%
# `simulate` takes the GF plus a tuple of args to pass to it.
key, sub_key = jax.random.split(key)

# %% [markdown]
# The choice map being the point of focus of the trace in most discussions, we often abusively just speak of a *trace* when we really mean its *choice map*.

# %% [markdown]
# ### GenJAX API for traces
#
# One can access the primitive choices in a trace using the method `get_choices`.
# One can access from a trace the GF that produced it using `trace.get_gen_fn()`, along with with arguments that were supplied using `trace.get_args()`, and the return value sample of the GF using the method `get_retval()`.  See below the fold for examples of all these.

# ### Traces: scores/weights/densities
#
# Traced execution of a generative function also produces a particular kind of score/weight/density.  It is very important to be clear about which score/weight/density value is to be expected, and why.  Consider the following generative function
# ```
# p = 0.25
# @genjax.gen
# def g(x,y):
#   flip = genjax.flip(p) @ 'flip'
#   return jax.lax.select(flip, x, y)
# end
# ```
# that, given two inputs `x` and `y`, flips a coin with weight `p`, and accordingly returns `x` or `y`.  When `x` and `y` are unequal, a sensible reporting of the score/weight/density in the sampling process would produce `p` or `1.0-p` accordingly.  If the user supplied equal values `x == y`, then which score/weight/density should be returned?
#
# One tempting view identifies a GF with a *distribution over its return values*.  In this view, the correct score/weight/density of `g` above would be $1$.
#
# The mathematical picture would be as follows.  Given a stochastic function $g$ from $X$ to $X'$, the results of calling $g$ on the input $x$ are described by a probability distribution $k_{g;x}$ on $X'$.  A family of probability distributions of this form is called a *probability kernel* and is indicated by the dashed arrow $k_g \colon X \dashrightarrow X'$.  And for some $x,x'$ we would be seeking the density $k_{g;x}(x')$ with which the sample $x' \sim k_{g;x}$ occurs.  Pursuing this approach requires knowlege of all execution histories that $g$ that might have followed from $x$ to $x'$, and then performing a sum or integral over them.  For some small finite situations this may be fine, but this general problem of computing marginalizations is computationally impossible.
#
# The marginalization question is especially forced upon us when trying to compose stochastic functions.  Given a second stochastic function $g'$ from $X'$ to $X''$, corresponding to a probability kernel $k_{g'} \colon X' \dashrightarrow X''$, the composite $g' \circ g$ from $X$ to $X''$ should correspond to the following probability kernel $k_{g' \circ g} \colon X \dashrightarrow X''$.  To sample $x'' \sim k_{g' \circ g;x}$ means "sample $x' \sim k_{g;x}$, then sample $x'' \sim k_{g';x'}$, then return $x''$".  However, computing the density $k_{g' \circ g;x}(x'')$, even if one can compute $k_{g;x}(x')$ and $k_{g';x'}(x'')$ for any given $x,x',x''$, would require summing or integrating over all possible intermediate values $x'$ (which manifests an "execution history" of $g' \circ g$) that could have intervened in producing $x''$ given $x$.
#
# Therefore, distribution-over-return-values is ***not the viewpoint of Gen***, and the score/weight/density being introduced here is a ***different number***.
#
# The only thing a program can reasonably be expected to know is the score/weight/density of its arriving at its return value *via the particular stochastic computation path* that got it there, and the approach of Gen is to report this number.  The corresponding mathematical picture imagines GFs as factored into *distributions over choice maps*, whose score/weight/density is computable, together with *deterministic functions on these data* that produce the return value from them.  In mathematical language, a GF $g$ from $X$ to $X'$ corresponds to the data of an auxiliary space $U_g$ containing all of the choice map information, a probability kernel $k_g \colon X \dashrightarrow U_g$ (with computable density) embodying the stochastic execution history, and a deterministic function that we will (somewhat abusively) denote $g \colon X \times U_g \to X'$ embodying extraction of the return value from the particular stochastic execution choices.
#
# In the toy example `g` above, choice map consists of `flip` so the space $U_g$ is binary; the deterministic computation $g$ amounts to the `return` statement; and the score/weight/density is `p` or `1.0-p`, regardless of whether the inputs are equal.
#
# Tractable compositionality holds in this formulation; let's spell it out.  If another GF $g'$ from $X'$ to $X''$ has data $U_{g'}$, $k_{g'}$, and $g' \colon X' \times U_{g'} \to X''$, then the composite GF $g' \circ g$ from $X$ to $X''$ has the following data.
# * The auxiliary space is $U_{g' \circ g} := U_g \times U_{g'}$.
# * The kernel $k_{g' \circ g}$ is defined by "sample $u \sim k_{g;x}$, then compute $x' = \text{ret}_g(x,u)$, then sample $u' \sim k_{g';x'}$, then return $(u,u')$", and
# * its density is computed via $k_{g' \circ g; x}(u,u') := k_{g;x}(u) \cdot k_{g';g(x,u)}(u')$.
# * The return value function is $(g' \circ g)(x,(u,u')) := g'(g(x,u),u')$.
#
# As one composes more GFs, the auxiliary space accumulates more factors $U$, reflecting how the "execution history" consists of longer and longer records.
#
# In this picture, one may still be concerned with the distribution on return values as in the straw man viewpoint.  This information is still embodied in the aggregate of the stochastic executions that lead to any return value, together with their weights.  (Consider that this is true even in the toy example!  More math?)  In a sense, when we kick the can of marginalization down the road, we can proceed without difficulty.
#
# A final caveat: The common practice of confusing traces with their choice maps continues here, and we speak of a GF inducing a "distribution over traces".

# %% [markdown]
# Let's have a look at the score/weight/densities in our running example.
#
# A pose consists of a pair $z = (z_\text p, z_\text{hd})$ where $z_\text p$ is a position vector and $z_\text{hd}$ is an angle.  A control consists of a pair $(s, \eta)$ where $s$ is a distance of displacement and $\eta$ is a change in angle.  Write $u(\theta) = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$ for the unit vector in the direction $\theta$.  We are given a "world" $w$ and "motion settings" parameters $\nu = (\nu_\text p, \nu_\text{hd})$.
#
# The models `start_pose_prior` and `step_model` correspond to distributions over their traces, respectively written $\text{start}$ and $\text{step}$.  In both cases these traces consist of the choices at addresses `:p` and `:hd`, so they may be identified with poses $z$ as above.  The distributions are defined as follows, when $y$ is a pose:
# * $z \sim \text{start}(y, \nu)$ means that $z_\text p \sim \text{mvnormal}(y_\text p, \nu_\text p^2 I)$ and $z_\text{hd} \sim \text{normal}(y_\text{hd}, \nu_\text{hd})$ independently.
# * $z \sim \text{step}(y, (s, \eta), w, \nu)$ means that $z_\text p \sim \text{mvnormal}(y_\text p + s\,u(y_\text{hd}), \nu_\text p^2 I)$ and $z_\text{hd} \sim \text{normal}(y_\text{hd} + \eta, \nu_\text {hd})$ independently.
#
# The return values $\text{retval}(z)$ of these models are obtained from traces $z$ by reducing $z_\text{hd}$ modulo $2\pi$, and in the second case applying collision physics (relative to $w$) to the path from $y_\text p$ to $z_\text p$.  (We invite the reader to imagine if PropComp required us to compute the marginal density of the return value here!)  We have the following closed form for the density functions:
# $$\begin{align*}
# P_\text{start}(z; y, \nu)
# &= P_\text{mvnormal}(z_\text p; y_\text p, \nu_\text p^2 I)
# \cdot P_\text{normal}(z_\text{hd}; y_\text{hd}, \nu_\text{hd}), \\
# P_\text{step}(z; y, (s, \eta), w, \nu)
# &= P_\text{mvnormal}(z_\text p; y_\text p + s\,u(y_\text{hd}), \nu_\text p^2 I)
# \cdot P_\text{normal}(z_\text{hd}; y_\text{hd} + \eta, \nu_\text{hd}).
# \end{align*}$$
#
# In general, the density of any trace factors as the product of the densities of the individual primitive choices that appear in it.  Since the primitive distributions of the language are equipped with efficient probability density functions, this overall computation is tractable.  It is represented by `Gen.get_score`:

# ### Modifying traces
#
# The metaprogramming approach of Gen affords the opportunity to explore alternate stochastic execution histories.  Namely, `trace.update` takes as inputs a source of randomness, together with modifications to its arguments and primitive choice values, and returns an accordingly modified trace. It also returns (the log of) the ratio of the updated trace's density to the original trace's density, together with a precise record of the resulting modifications that played out.
#
# One could, for instance, consider just the placement of the first step, and replace its stochastic choice of heading with an updated value. The original trace was typical under the pose prior model, whereas the modified one may be rather less likely. This plot is annotated with log of how much unlikelier, the score ratio:

# Another capability of `trace.update` is to modify the *arguments* to the generative function

# controls, and we wish to explore the space of paths incrementally in the timestep:

# TODO(colin): Seek approval for the following modification of the notebook:
# I propose we skip this demonstration for the following reasons.
# It is un-JAX-like to use a for loop like this. There are probably
# better examples of wanting to change an argument than this. Further,
# this seems to step around the `scan` structure of our path generation,
# and overall looks a bit like an anti-pattern from the JAX point of view.
# The tests that are done in the loop don't reveal much about the
# statistics of the situation, so I think getting this to work is more
# trouble than it's worth.
#
# Furthermore, I think it is much more valuable to understand using
# choicemaps to adjust random choices in Gen than it is to fiddle with
# parameters.

# change_only_T = (UnknownChange(), NoChange(), NoChange(), NoChange())

# ## Inference
# ### Why we need inference: in a picture
#
# The path obtained by integrating the controls serves as a proposal for the true path, but it is unsatisfactory, especially in the high motion deviation case. The picture gives an intuitive sense of the fit:
# %%

animate_bare_sensors(path_integrated, walls_plot)
# %% [markdown]
# It would seem that the fit is reasonable in low motion deviation, but really breaks down in high motion deviation.
#
# We are not limited to visual judgments here: the model can quantitatively assess how good a fit the integrated path is for the data.  In order to do this, we detour to explain how to produce samples from our model that agree with the fixed observation data.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Producing samples with constraints
#
# We have seen how `simulate` performs traced execution of a generative function: as the program runs, it draws stochastic choices from all required primitive distributions, and records them in a choice map.
#
# Given a choice map of *constraints* that declare fixed values of some of the primitive choices, the operation `importance` proposes traces of the generative function that are consistent with these constraints.

# %%

sample, log_weight = full_model_importance(sub_key, constraints_low_deviation, (genjax.Const(motion_settings_low_deviation),))

animate_full_trace(sample) | f"log_weight: {log_weight}"
# %% [markdown]
# A trace resulting from a call to `importance` is structurally indistinguishable from one drawn from `simulate`.  But there is a key situational difference: while `get_score` always returns the frequency with which `simulate` stochastically produces the trace, this value is **no longer equal to** the frequency with which the trace is stochastically produced by `importance`.  This is both true in an obvious and less relevant sense, as well as true in a more subtle and extremely germane sense.
#
# On the superficial level, since all traces produced by `importance` are consistent with the constraints, those traces that are inconsistent with the constraints do not occur at all, and in aggregate the traces that are consistent with the constraints are more common.
#
# More deeply and importantly, the stochastic choice of the *constraints* under a run of `simulate` might have any density, perhaps very low.  This constraints density contributes as always to the `get_score`, whereas it does not influence the frequency of producing this trace under `importance`.
#
# The ratio of the `get_score` of a trace to the probability density that `importance` would produce it with the given constraints, is called the *importance weight*.  For convenience, (the log of) this quantity is returned by `importance` along with the trace.
#
# We stress the basic invariant:
# $$
# \text{get\_score}(\text{trace})
# =
# (\text{weight from importance})
# \cdot
# (\text{frequency simulate creates this trace}).
# $$
# %% [markdown]
# The preceding comments apply to generative functions in wide generality.  We can say even more about our present examples, because further assumptions hold.
# 1. There is no untraced randomness.  Given a full choice map for constraints, everything else is deterministic.  In particular, the importance weight is the `get_score`.
# 2. The generative function was constructed using GenJAX's DSL and primitive distributions.  Ancestral sampling; `importance` with empty constraints reduces to `simulate` with importance weight $1$.
# 3. Combined, the importance weight is directly computed as the `project` of the trace upon the choice map addresses that were constrained in the call to `importance`.
#
#   In our running example, the projection in question is $\prod_{t=0}^T P_\text{sensor}(o_t)$.
