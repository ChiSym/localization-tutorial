    "```\n",
    "that, given two inputs `x` and `y`, flips a coin with weight `p`, and accordingly returns `x` or `y`.  When `x` and `y` are unequal, a sensible reporting of the score/weight/density in the sampling process would produce `p` or `1.0-p` accordingly.  If the user supplied equal values `x == y`, then which score/weight/density should be returned?\n",
    "\n",
    "One tempting view identifies a GF with a *distribution over its return values*.  In this view, the correct score/weight/density of `g` above would be $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical picture would be as follows.  Given a stochastic function $g$ from $X$ to $X'$, the results of calling $g$ on the input $x$ are described by a probability distribution $k_{g;x}$ on $X'$.  A family of probability distributions of this form is called a *probability kernel* and is indicated by the dashed arrow $k_g \\colon X \\dashrightarrow X'$.  And for some $x,x'$ we would be seeking the density $k_{g;x}(x')$ with which the sample $x' \\sim k_{g;x}$ occurs.  Pursuing this approach requires knowlege of all execution histories that $g$ that might have followed from $x$ to $x'$, and then performing a sum or integral over them.  For some small finite situations this may be fine, but this general problem of computing marginalizations is computationally impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The marginalization question is especially forced upon us when trying to compose stochastic functions.  Given a second stochastic function $g'$ from $X'$ to $X''$, corresponding to a probability kernel $k_{g'} \\colon X' \\dashrightarrow X''$, the composite $g' \\circ g$ from $X$ to $X''$ should correspond to the following probability kernel $k_{g' \\circ g} \\colon X \\dashrightarrow X''$.  To sample $x'' \\sim k_{g' \\circ g;x}$ means \"sample $x' \\sim k_{g;x}$, then sample $x'' \\sim k_{g';x'}$, then return $x''$\".  However, computing the density $k_{g' \\circ g;x}(x'')$, even if one can compute $k_{g;x}(x')$ and $k_{g';x'}(x'')$ for any given $x,x',x''$, would require summing or integrating over all possible intermediate values $x'$ (which manifests an \"execution history\" of $g' \\circ g$) that could have intervened in producing $x''$ given $x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, distribution-over-return-values is ***not the viewpoint of Gen***, and the score/weight/density being introduced here is a ***different number***.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only thing a program can reasonably be expected to know is the score/weight/density of its arriving at its return value *via the particular stochastic computation path* that got it there, and the approach of Gen is to report this number.  The corresponding mathematical picture imagines GFs as factored into *distributions over choice maps*, whose score/weight/density is computable, together with *deterministic functions on these data* that produce the return value from them.  In mathematical language, a GF $g$ from $X$ to $X'$ corresponds to the data of an auxiliary space $U_g$ containing all of the choice map information, a probability kernel $k_g \\colon X \\dashrightarrow U_g$ (with computable density) embodying the stochastic execution history, and a deterministic function that we will (somewhat abusively) denote $g \\colon X \\times U_g \\to X'$ embodying extraction of the return value from the particular stochastic execution choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the toy example `g` above, choice map consists of `flip` so the space $U_g$ is binary; the deterministic computation $g$ amounts to the `return` statement; and the score/weight/density is `p` or `1.0-p`, regardless of whether the inputs are equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tractable compositionality holds in this formulation; let's spell it out.  If another GF $g'$ from $X'$ to $X''$ has data $U_{g'}$, $k_{g'}$, and $g' \\colon X' \\times U_{g'} \\to X''$, then the composite GF $g' \\circ g$ from $X$ to $X''$ has the following data.\n",
    "* The auxiliary space is $U_{g' \\circ g} := U_g \\times U_{g'}$.\n",
    "* The kernel $k_{g' \\circ g}$ is defined by \"sample $u \\sim k_{g;x}$, then compute $x' = \\text{ret}_g(x,u)$, then sample $u' \\sim k_{g';x'}$, then return $(u,u')$\", and\n",
    "* its density is computed via $k_{g' \\circ g; x}(u,u') := k_{g;x}(u) \\cdot k_{g';g(x,u)}(u')$.\n",
    "* The return value function is $(g' \\circ g)(x,(u,u')) := g'(g(x,u),u')$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As one composes more GFs, the auxiliary space accumulates more factors $U$, reflecting how the \"execution history\" consists of longer and longer records.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this picture, one may still be concerned with the distribution on return values as in the straw man viewpoint.  This information is still embodied in the aggregate of the stochastic executions that lead to any return value, together with their weights.  (Consider that this is true even in the toy example!  More math?)  In a sense, when we kick the can of marginalization down the road, we can proceed without difficulty.\n",
