# TODO

* Features
  * Low light: sensor coin flip / normal(max range value)
  * Otherwise hierarchical (sensor) model?
  * alternate world models for comparison with robot model.  Examples: variants of parameters
* Expos
  * Explain SMCP3 weights
  * Rif comments: Correct understanding of initial pose.
* Debugging
  * Tweak the numerics parameters to make the case more clearly
  * fix any text/comments, add any docstrings?, image filenames
* Visualization
  * Better signposting of SMC logging code
  * Color sensor reading picture lines via when unexpectedly low likelihood.
  * plotting multiple traces: sequencing vs. tiling vs. alpha-blending (in each case indicate weights differently)
  * label all (hyper)parameters in visualizations
