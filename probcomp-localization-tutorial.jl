# * Get a sense of the various sources of "synthetic" data.  First path is hard-wired.  Other paths and/or sensor data?
# * Consolidate (3?) MH proposals.  PF w/o Rejuv.  Consolidate PF+MH-Rejuvs.  PF+SMCP3-Rejuv.  Else?
# * Hierarchical (sensor) model?
# * Fix global vars in rejection_sample etc.
#
# Rif comments:
# * Correct understanding of initial pose.

# ## The "real world"
#
# We assume given
# * a map of a space, together with
# * some clutters that sometimes unexpectedly exist in that space.
#
# We also assume given a description of a robot's behavior via
# * an estimated initial pose (= position + heading), and
# * a program of controls (= advance distance, followed by rotate heading).
#
# *In addition to the uncertainty in the initial pose, we are uncertain about the true execution of the motion of the robot.*
#
# Below, we will also introduce sensors.

# ## Inference: main idea
#
# In the viewpoint of ProbComp, the goal of *inference* is to produce *likely* traces of a full model, given the observed data.  In other words, *generative functions induce distributions on traces*, and if we view the full model as a program embodying a *prior*, then applying an inference metaprogram to it (together with the observed data) produces a new program that embodies the *posterior*.
#
# There is no free lunch in this game: generic inference recipies are inefficient.  Rather, efficiency becomes possible as we exploit what we actually know about the problem in our design of the inference strategy.  Gen's aim is to provide the right entry points to enact this exploitation.
#
# To picture this, here are the paths produced by the model in aggregate, to get an approximate sense of the prior as a distribution.  Next to it is a similar picture of what the posterior, our goal, looks like.  (The inference process is a *black box* for this moment, and will be approached through the rest of this notebook.)

# Mathematically, we describe inference as follows.
#
# Recall that our `model_full_1` generative function defined a probability distribution $P_\text{full}(\textbf{z}_{0:T}, \textbf{o}_{0:T})$.
#
# When the robot actually travels through the world, its sensors pick up a collection of measurements $\textbf{o}_{0:T}^*$.
#
# The goal of inference is to characterize the _posterior_ probability distribution
# $
# P_\text{full}(\textbf{z}_{0:T} | \textbf{o}^*_{0:T})
# $.
# This is the probability distribution defined such that
# $$
# P_\text{full}(\textbf{z}_{0:T} | \textbf{o}_{0:T}) := \frac{
#     P_\text{full}(\textbf{z}_{0:T}, \textbf{o}_{0:T})
# }{
#     P_\text{full}(\textbf{o}_{0:T})
# }
# $$
#
# The posterior distribution is a distribution over the space of latent trajectories $\textbf{z}_{0:T}$.  The posterior distribution answers the question: after observing observation sequence $\textbf{o}^*_{0:T}$, what would an optimal agent _believe_ about the latent trajectory?  The answer is: its belief is characterized by the distribution $P_\text{full}(\textbf{z}_{0:T} | \textbf{o}^*_{0:T})$.
#
# In the definition of the posterior distribution, we used the term $P_\text{full}(\textbf{o}_{0:T})$.  This is the _marginal distribution over the observations_.  This is defined by
# $$
# P_\text{full}(\textbf{o}_{0:T}) := \int P_\text{full}(\textbf{z}_{0:T}, \textbf{o}_{0:T}) d\textbf{z}_{0:T}
# $$
# It describes the agent's prior belief about how likely a given observation sequence is to occur, given the controls that are used.

# ## Strategies for inference
#
# We now spell out some strategies for conditioning the ouputs of our model towards the observed sensor data.  These metaprograms employ the following richer aspects of generative functions.
#
# ### Deeper functionality of GFs
#
# Rif asks: maybe these discussions are too simplified?
#
# Traced execution of generative functions, via `Gen.simulate` as seen above, is a straightforward alternative semantic interpretation.  A more refined operation, `Gen.generate`, allows two deeper features.
#
# 1. It proposes traces satisfying optional *constraints*.  
# Note that the `get_choices(trace)` returns a tree with nodes at all invokations of `~` to sample from generative functions.  The *leaf* nodes correspond to *primitive choices* coming from honest *distributions*.  Presently, Gen only works with constraints upon these *primitive* choices.  The constraints are recorded in structures called *choice maps*, as modified in the black box code cell above.
#
# 2. It returns the proposed trace along with a *(log) weight*, which we then use in our inference strategies.  
# The meaning of this weight is complex:  The trace proposal code need not produce traces with frequencies according to the "actual" distribution represented by the function‚Äîit is allowed to do something simpler and more computationally efficient.  The weight represents any difference between the proposal frequencies and the "actual" frequencies, plus contributions arising from any imposed constraints.
#
# Along the same lines, given a trace, one may perform simple modifications of it using `Gen.update` without rerunning the entire GF, and it returns along with the new trace the difference in weights.

# %% [markdown]
# ### Sampling / importance resampling
#
# Let's try a classic generic inference strategy, *sampling / importance resampling (SIR)*.  The idea is to independently draw a number of samples with weights, called *particles*, in order to explore the space of the distribution, and then to select one of them in proportion to its weight as a representative.

# %% [markdown]
# **Sample generation.**
#
# Specifically, this algorithm will generate $N$ possible latent trajectories:
# $$\textbf{z}_{0:T}^i \sim P_\text{trajectory\_prior} \text{ for } i=1, 2, \dots, N$$
#
# Here, $P_\text{trajectory\_prior}(\textbf{z}_{0:T}) := P_{\text{pose}_0}(\textbf{z}_0) \prod_{t=1}^T{P_\text{step}(\textbf{z}_t ; \textbf{z}_{t-1})}$.
#
# Note that these trajectories are generated entirely without considering the robot's observations $\textbf{o}_{0:T}^*$.
#
# **Weight computation.**
#
# After generating $N$ trajectories, SIR computes the following _weight_, $w^i$, for each sample $\textbf{z}_{0:T}^i$:
# $$
# w^i := \frac{
# P_\text{full}(\textbf{z}^i_{0:T}, \textbf{o}_{0:T})
# }{
# P_\text{trajectory\_prior}(\textbf{z}^i_{0:T})
# }
# $$
#
# This $w^i$ will be large for samples $\textbf{z}^i_{0:T}$ which seem consistent with the observations $\textbf{o}_{0:T}$, since then $P_\text{full}(\textbf{z}^i_{0:T}, \textbf{o}_{0:T})$ will be large.
#
# **Weight normalization.**
#
# After computing the $w^i$, SIR computes _normalized_ weights,
# $$
# \hat{w}^i = \frac{w^i}{\sum_{j=1}^N{w^j}}
# $$
# Note that $[\hat{w}^1, \hat{w}^2, \dots, \hat{w}^N]$ is a probability distribution.
#
# **Resampling.**
#
# The last step of SIR is to _resample_ $M$ of the original $N$ particles.  That is, SIR will choose $M$ of the $N$ original samples $\textbf{z}_{0:T}^i$, which appear consistent with the observations.  It does this by being more likely to choose samples with high $w^i$ values.
#
# Specifically, resampling first chooses $M$ particle indices, $i_1, \dots, i_M$, according to
# $$
# \forall k, i_k \sim \text{categorical}([\hat{w}^1, \hat{w}^2, \dots, \hat{w}^N])
# $$
# Put another way, $P(i_k = j) = \hat{w}^j$.
#
# Finally, SIR outputs the collection of trajectories $\textbf{z}^{i_1}_{0:T}, \textbf{z}^{i_2}_{0:T}, \dots, \textbf{z}^{i_M}_{0:T}$.
#
# **Summary:** SIR generates possible samples without considering the observations $\textbf{o}_{0:T}^*$, but attempts to ultimately output a sub-collection of these randomly generated samples which are consistent with the observations.  It does this by computing the weights $w^i$.

# We may convert our program into a sampler for the target distribution via the metaprogram that draws samples and weights, stochastically accepts them with frequency equal to the reported ratio, and otherwise rejects them and tries again.  This metaprogram is called *rejection sampling*.
#
# Suppose that our stochastic program only reports *unnormalized* ratios of their generated frequency to the target frequency.  That is, there exists some constant $Z$ such that $Z$ times the correct ratio is reported.  If we knew $Z$, we could just correct the reported ratios by $Z$.  But suppose $Z$ itself is unavailable, and we only know a bound $C$ for $Z$, that is $Z < C$.  Then we can correct the ratios by $C$, obtaining an algorithm that is correct but inefficient by a factor of drawing $C/Z$ too many samples on average.  This metaprogram is called *approximate rejection sampling*.
#
# Finally, suppose we know that $Z$ exists, but we do not even know a bound $C$ for it.  Then we may proceed adaptively by tracking the largest weight encountered thus far, and using this number $C$ as above.  This metaprogram is called *adaptive approximate rejection sampling*.
#
# Earlier samples may occur with too high absolute frequency, but over time as $C$ appropriately increases, the behavior tends towards the true distribution.  We may consider some of this early phase to be an *exploration* or *burn-in period*, and accordingly draw samples but keep only the maximum of their weights, before moving on to the rejection sampling *per se*.

# # Particle filter with MCMC Rejuvenation
#
# However, it is possible to use Gen to write more sophisticated inference algorithms which scale much better in the path lengths.
# These inference algorithms are implemented using the GFI methods (like `generate`, `propose`, `assess`, and `update`).
#
# (Gen also contains a library of built-in inference algorithm implementations; but we have spelled out the implementation below in terms of the GFI to illustrate the types of powerful inference algorithms one can develop with only a few dozen lines of code.)
#
# ## Key idea #1: resample after each timestep ('particle filtering')
#
# SIR and rejection sampling generate full trajectories $\textbf{z}_{0:T}$ from $P_{\text{trajectory\_prior}}$, and only consider the observations $\textbf{o}_{0:T}$ at the end.
#
# Instead, _particle filtering_ generates $\textbf{z}_t$ values one at a time, and considers the observed value $\textbf{o}_{0:T}$ one at a time.
#
# Specifically, particle filtering works as follows.
# 1. TIME 0 - Generate $N$ values $\textbf{z}_0^i \sim P_{\text{pose}_0}$ for $i = 1, \dots, N$.
# 2. TIME 0 - For each $i$, compute $w^i_0 := \frac{P_{\text{full}_0}(\textbf{z}_0^i, \textbf{o}_0*)}{P_{\text{pose}_0}}$.  We write $P_{\text{full}_0}$ to denote the model $P_\text{full}$ unrolled to just the initial timestep.
# 3. TIME 0 - Compute the normalized weights $\hat{w}^i_0 = \frac{w^i}{\sum_{j=1}^N{w^j}}$.
# 4. TIME 0 - Resample.  For $j = 1, \dots, N$, let $a^j_0 \sim \text{categorical}([\hat{w}^1_0, \hat{w}^2_0, \dots, \hat{w}^N_0])$.
# 5. TIME 1 - Generate $N$ values $\textbf{z}_1^i \sim P_\text{step}(\textbf{z}_1 ; \textbf{z}_0^{a^i_0})$.
# 6. TIME 1 - For each $i$, compute $w^i_0 := \frac{P_{\text{full}_1}([\textbf{z}_0^{a^i_0}, \textbf{z}_1^i], \textbf{o}_{0:1}*)}P_\text{step}(\textbf{z}_1 ; \textbf{z}_0^{a^i_0})$.
# 7. TIME 1 - Compute normalized weights $\hat{w}^i_1$.
# 8. TIME 1 - Resample. For $j = 1, \dots, N$, let $a^j_1 \sim \text{categorical}([\hat{w}^1_1, \hat{w}^2_1, \dots, \hat{w}^N_1])$.
# 9. TIME 2 - Generate $N$ values $\textbf{z}_2^i \sim P_\text{step}(\textbf{z}_2 ; \textbf{z}_1^{a^i_1})$.
# 10. ...
#
# The key idea is that the algorithm _no longer needs to get as lucky_.  In SIR and rejection sampling, the algorithm needs to generate a full trajectory where every $\textbf{z}_t$ value just happens to be consistent with the observation $\textbf{o}_t$.  In a particle filter, at each step $t$, the algorihtm only needs to generate _one_ $\textbf{z}_t$ which is consistent with $\textbf{o}_t$, not a full trajectory over $T + 1$ points where all the values are consistent.  Resampling ensures that before proceeding to the next $t$ value, the value of $\textbf{z}_{t-1}$ is consistent with the observations.
#
# ## Key idea #2: iteratively improve each latent hypothesis ('Markov Chain Monte Carlo rejuvenation')
#
# Particle filtering can be further improved by adding _Markov Chain Monte Carlo_ rejuvenation.
#
# This adds a step to the particle filter after resampling, which iteratively tweaks the values $\textbf{z}_t^{a^i_t}$ to make them more consistent observations.

# # Inference controller to automatically spend the right amount of compute for good accuracy
#
# Now we'll write an inference controller which decides when to run SMCP3 rejuvenation, and how much SMCP3 rejuvenation to run, based on thresholding the estimated marginal data likelihood.
#
# To make inference more robust, I have also written the controller so that if the inference results still seem poor after rejuvenation, the inference algorithm can re-propose particles from the previous timestep.  This helps avoid "dead ends" where the particle filter proposes only unlikely particles that rejuvenation cannot fix, at some timestep.
#
# With low-motion-noise settings, this will automatically realize there is no need to run rejuvenation, and will achieve very fast runtimes.
#
# With high-motion noise settings, this will automatically realize that rejuvenation is needed at some steps to alleviate artifacts.
